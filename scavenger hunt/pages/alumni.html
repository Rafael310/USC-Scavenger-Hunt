    <p> This picture was taken in front of the Alumni House. The Widney Alumni House, built in 1880, is a state
        historical landmark and the oldest university building still in continuous use in Southern California. Today it
        is home to the USC Alumni Association. It has been part of the campus life for more than 130 years.

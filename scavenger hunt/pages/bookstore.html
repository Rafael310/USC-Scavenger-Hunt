    <p>This is a picture of one of USC's alma mater and it is called the "All Hail". It is located at the bookstore heading down the escalator. Since its
        founding in 1880, USC has had two alma maters. The first, also known as the “University Hymn,” was written by
        John Oliver Wilson ’08 and had four verses. The second – and current – alma mater is Alfred F. Wesson’s “All
        Hail.”

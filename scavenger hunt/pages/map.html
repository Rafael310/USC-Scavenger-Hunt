    <h1>USC map</h1>
    <img src="../assets/pic2.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This is the map of USC. It was a very useful tool that helped us navigate the campus. This map was very helpful
        and can be used to pinpoint certain location. It helped us find the Alumni House and Doheny Memorial Libarary
        (DML). It has much more information like dining places, the different libraries, and academic buildings.</p>
